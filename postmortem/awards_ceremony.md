Breakfast in the Dolomites is my first piece of interactive fiction.

That is not quite true: in the eighties I wrote some little 'adventures' with a BASIC interpreter, 
but they were very limited: not a real game.

Why did I come back after 40 years to write such a game? 
I tell the whole story in the introductory booklet that comes with the game, 
but I will briefly rewrite it here.

During the pandemic lockdown, I wrote a BBS system
that looks like the ones I used in the early '90s but using more conteporary systems: 
C#, Entity Framework, Maria DB and a Rapberry Pi 2 as host.  
I thought that a game should be great in it, why not an adventure game? 
They were very popular in those years.

Fortunately, the lockdown was over and the project has been shelved.

August 2023, in a small town in the Ahrntal, the northernmost valley in Italy, with my family.  
It was raining.

The kind reception girl points us to our room, in another building across the street:
"If you don't want to get wet, you can go through here" and points us to a staircase.  
We descend the staircase, which is covered with green carpet with rocking horses drawn on it.   
Unbelievably, there was a whole world to discover down there: 
a reading room with a small library, 
a well-equipped gym, game stations, billiards, table tennis...  
The walls were lined with showcases containing toy horses of various origins, 
from the smallest to those too big for a child to ride.

I take out my smartphone and start taking pictures; there are also mirrors to "play" with.  
"Playing", I think, what a great setting for an adventure game!

In the evening, I begin to explore the Internet to see if there are any examples I can take inspiration from, 
and to my amazement, I discover that entire development systems for such programs still exist, recently updated.  
I also find a very strange language, Inform7, download it and greedily read the manual.

I carried out various tests and finally came up with a little story 
that I wanted to present at the IFComp to collect opinions and suggestions.

I was ready for any kind of feedback, but I honestly did not expect to get a high ranking.
