==The Blurb==
It is the mid-1990s. On a Friday evening in the summer, a guy and his girlfriend leave work for a short holiday in the Dolomites.

You play as Francesco, about 30 years old, blond hair. Francesco works as a software engineer, he like photography and hiking in the mountains. Monica is his beautiful girlfriend: tall, slim, with lots of slightly reddish frizzy hair and sparkling green eyes: could he not fall in love with her? She loves strolling around looking in shop windows; a peppy girl, she won't forgive him for anything he does that she doesn't like, but deep down her heart beats for him. What a strange thing love is...

There are no treasures to be found, there are no mysteries to be solved; remember, you are on holiday: have fun!
